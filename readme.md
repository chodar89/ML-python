## This is tutorial from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujTCoH21GlA&list=RDCMUC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg&start_radio=1&t=51) by Tech With Tim. It is about Machine Learning with Python using TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn.
1. Linear Regression
- regression.py is using students data ("G1", "G2", "studytime", "failures", "absences") and finally predict grade for G3 where G is a term.

2. KNN - K Nearest Neighbors

3. SVM - Support Vector Machines
- Use breast cancer data from sklearn dataset and ML to predict is it 'malignant' or 'benign'
4. K Means Cluster
